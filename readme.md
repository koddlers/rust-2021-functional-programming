# Functional Programming in Rust 2021

by Shaun Meyer

This course will teach you functional programming in Rust for elegant, concise, and maintainable code. Learn closures,
iterators, lazy evaluation, immutability, higher-order functions, pattern matching, and error handling with Result and
Option types.

In this course, Functional Programming in Rust 2021, you'll learn to create elegant, concise, and maintainable code
using functional programming techniques. First, you'll explore the core concepts of closures, iterators, and lazy
evaluation. Next, you'll discover the importance of immutability, higher-order functions, and pattern matching. Finally,
you'll learn how to effectively handle errors using Result and Option types. When you're finished with this course,
you'll have the skills and knowledge of functional programming in Rust needed to build robust and scalable Rust
applications.
